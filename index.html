      <p>I am a mother of three rambunctions girls that keep me active.  We have two cats named Sparkles and Cinder.  Additionally we have a small black dog named Jewel.  We are a busy non-stop family.  </p>

      <p>Additionally, I enjoy long distance running.  I am suppose to training for the Los Angeles Marathon, but my coding class is keeping me pretty occupied.  It is all good because before you know it I will be creating some pretty spiffy websites.</p>
      <p>I enjoy reading about personal development and going to workshops.  I even saw Oprah Winfrey when she was doing a tour in San Jose, California.  Unfortunately, she was not giving away cars to her large audience.  Oh well, maybe next time. </p>
